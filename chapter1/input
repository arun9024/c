nput from a terminal never really "ends" (unless the device is disconnected), 
but it is useful to enter more than one "file" into a terminal, so a key sequence 
is reserved to indicate end of input. In UNIX the translation of the keystroke to 
EOF is performed by the terminal driver, so a program does not need to distinguish 
terminals from other input files. By default, the driver converts a Control-D 
character at the start of a line into an end-of-file indicator. To insert an actual 
Control-D (ASCII 04) character into the input stream, the user precedes it with a 
"quote" command character (usually Control-V). AmigaDOS is similar but uses Control-\ 
instead of Control-D.

In Microsoft's DOS and Windows (and in CP/M and many DEC operating systems), reading 
from the terminal will never produce an EOF. Instead, programs recognize that the source 
is a terminal (or other "character device") and interpret a given reserved character or 
sequence as an end-of-file indicator; most commonly this is an ASCII Control-Z, code 26. 
Some MS-DOS programs, including parts of the Microsoft MS-DOS shell (COMMAND.COM) and 
operating-system utility programs (such as EDLIN), treat a Control-Z in a text file as 
marking the end of meaningful data, and/or append a Control-Z to the end when writing a 
text file. This was done for two reasons
